# Task Goblin API

Task Goblin API is a minimal and clean task management REST API built with Spring Boot 3, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.  
It implements a simple layered architecture (controller → service → repository) and provides three core operations:

- Create a task
- List all tasks
- Mark a task as completed

This project serves as a compact example of a well-structured Spring Boot application using standard conventions and best practices.
